# First Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my first personal portfolio website! This website was created to showcase my work and projects, and while it may not look as great as my current portfolio, it was a valuable learning experience for me.

One of the features of this website is the automatic scrolling to the relevant section when you click on a navigation tag. This functionality makes it easy to navigate through the different sections of the website and find the information you need.

Additionally, when you click on the "Show More Projects" button, more projects are displayed on the page. These projects are pulled from an array of objects that I created to store my projects, each with their own unique information.

While this is not my current portfolio, it still represents an important step in my journey as a developer. I learned a lot about web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gained valuable experience in building a website from scratch.
